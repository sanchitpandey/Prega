## What is prega.io? 🤔


 
During the time of pregnany moms need to take care of her and also a lot of documents like - prescriptions, reports and they also need to remember a lot of things like medicine updates, allergies (they might have), things what to do and what not do. And it becomes a lot hectic. 

Also for every doctor visit they need to take a lot of previous reports, prescriptions and all other stuff. And there is no easy way of sharing them with doctor.

We have seen this problem and identified there is nothing in the market which specifically handles this situation. And it's our mother for whom we are here. So, why not build something which can solve a big problem for them.
